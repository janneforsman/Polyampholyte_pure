cDFTcode.f is the fortran code for polyampholyte salt calculations.

Results for 1mM 15-mers are collected in "15-mers_1mM"
with sub-directories.

In "simplesalt" you will find code plus input data for simple 1:1 salts.

The "appendix" directory is what the name suggests.

The research was published in "Exceptionally Strong Double-Layer Barriers Generated by Polyampholyte Salt", 
by Ribar, David and Woodward, Clifford E. and Forsman, Jan, in The Journal of Physical Chemistry B.
