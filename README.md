# Polyampholyte_pure
Exceptionally strong double-layer barriers generated by polyampholyte salt


cDFTcode.f is the fortran code for polyampholyte salt calculations.

Results for 1mM 15-mers are collected in "15-mers_1mM"
with sub-directories.

In "simplesalt" you will find code plus input data for simple 1:1 salts.

The "appendix" directory is what the name suggests.
